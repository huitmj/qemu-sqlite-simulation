# Performance Testing VM Configuration
# High-performance configuration for benchmarking and load testing

# Memory allocation (large for performance testing)
MEMORY="8G"

# Number of CPU cores (maximum performance)
CPU="8"

# Additional QEMU arguments
# Network: Virtio for best network performance
# Storage: Virtio with caching for I/O performance
# CPU: Host CPU passthrough for maximum performance
# Memory: Huge pages support (if available)
ADDITIONAL_ARGS="-netdev user,id=net0 -device virtio-net,netdev=net0 -nographic -serial stdio -enable-kvm -cpu host -machine q35 -smp 8 -device virtio-balloon"

# VM-specific notes:
# - Maximum CPU and memory allocation
# - KVM acceleration required
# - Host CPU features passed through
# - Virtio drivers for best I/O performance
# - Balloon driver for dynamic memory
# - Ideal for performance benchmarking
# - Requires sufficient host resources
